# Rewards

Many contributors voluntarily contribute to open source projects for free, but we reward contributors monthly who solved our issues and ensure better progress for this repository in the future.

We will also carry out various of communication activities:

1. Regularly organize salons to provide transportation and accommodation fees for contributions from other area
2. Invite contributors to participate in tourism, and websoft9 is responsible for tourism expenses
3. Hold an annual meeting, we will select outstanding contributors of the year and give rewards ranging from ¥1000 to ¥3000

## How to pricing an issue?

There are two processes refer to an issue: research and coding to implementation.

The following noun explanations can help you better understand the price of an issue:

- An issue total reward = Research reward + Implementation reward
- The workload completed within a unit size is considered as a **work-point**, a work-point's price is ¥50.
- work-point refer to Technical popularity, Developer stacks, Document reading ability
- Level of Developer Capability: High, Middle, Low are replaced with L, M, and H respectively
