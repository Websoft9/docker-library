# Developer Guide

- Write the dockerfile if there no suitale image for the application
- Write the docker-compose file and .env as per specifications
- Test it and pull request

Our specifications is very simple, you just only add the environments begin with **APP\_** reference from template

## Architecture

The architecture of the library is relatively simple, which is a collection of a large number of apps that are uniformly placed in the apps director. Each folder under apps is an independent and runnable Docker Compose project.

## Docker compose

You can understand the basic composition and specifications through the [Docker Compose template file](../template/docker-compose.yml), The following points will help you quickly integrate into library project.

### Use official docker image

Try to use the official image as much as possible, unless there is no maintenance or updates have been stopped.

And you can also get image from public image hub:

- [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws)

### Microservices

The images used should be componentized as much as possible, with app main images and DB images, and web server images connected to achieve software availability.

### Networks

All containers are placed on the network named **websoft9**, making them accessible to each other through container names.

### Volumes

We define all the names that need to be mounted at the end of docker-compose.yml and use them through references in different container.

### Health check

Whether the container starts normally through [Health check](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck)

### Logs limit

Some application have lots of logs which will need storages. If you want to limit it, below is referance

```
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:$APP_VERSION
    container_name: $APP_NAME
    restart: unless-stopped
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-file: "5"
          max-size: 10m
```

## Environment variables

The environment variables of the container is the interface between the container and external interactions, the library all of the apps's environment variables are imported through **.env** file and cannot be directly defined in the docker-compose.yml, you can understand the basic composition and specifications through the [.env template file](../template/.env).

The environments begin with **APP\_** is core environment variables. Generally speaking, developers only define and use them.
We will list and explain commonly used environmental variables as following table:

| Variable name          | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Necessity |

> main container: When the container has web pages, the corresponding container of the page is the main container; When a container has no pages, the corresponding container for the core application is usually the main container.

## Build docker image of websoft9

When we cannot find a suitable image, we have to compile the image by Dockerfile,We make a requirement in the following aspects.

## Parent Image

The parent image needs to follow the following point:

- The preferred image is the one provided by the official, as the official image has undergone extensive testing and verification, and has good stability and reliability.
- Select the smallest possible base image to reduce the size of the image and potential security vulnerabilities.
- Select images that have undergone security review and frequent updates.

### Structure

Main related files are all placed in two directories:

- root directory: Dockerfile, cmd.sh, entrypoint.sh
- src directory: config files or need to edit executable files

### Maintainability

Sufficient external interfaces need to be provided through environment variables, such as username,passowrd,port.

### LABEL

The elements of label are necessary: such as version,vendor,description.

## PHP configuration

1. Docker official image or Bitnami image have different method for php configuration
2. Docker official image need mount php_exra.ini to container
3. Bitnami image have envs of php configuration
4. As a reference, other php application should check if php conf.d directoy exist in container, mount php_exra.ini to this path

## variables.json

Every application must contain a variables.json, which contains information such as version, trademark, document reference address, and running environment requirements.
